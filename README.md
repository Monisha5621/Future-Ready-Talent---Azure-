This is a project that would be deployed in Azure ML, the model predicts the Diagnosis of Diabetes and 3  Classification Models were tested, of which Logistics Regression performed well with greater accuracy. 
The 3 Classification Models are - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, each has accuracy of 80%, 76% and 74% respectively. 
The dataset is the famous Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, "The Pima (or Akimel O'odham, also spelled Akimel O'otham, "River People", formerly known as Pima) are a group of Native Americans living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona.
